# Platypus Weather App: Current Conditions and Multi-day Forecast

## Overview:
Hello! Welcome to **Platypus Weather**, a user friendly app for everybody, regardless of computer knowledge. My kids, grandparents, other family, and friends all can use it. Plus, they enjoy the cool aesthetic reminiscent of the cool colors a platypus gives off under UV light! *(No really, you should Google it)*.  I built this project with the help of a mentor and friend in my journey to become a software engineer.

Simply put in your zip code and the app will show your city’s temperature in Fahrenheit, current weather conditions, the high and low temperature for the day, and wind speed. It’s that easy! 

## How to Build:
This project is built with JavaScript - React and TypeScript, using React Router to navigate between pages, and styled with CSS/Sass and MaterialUI. It uses Axios to **asynchronously fetch data** from [Visual Crossing’s free weather API ](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api).
