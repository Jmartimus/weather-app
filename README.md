## Live App <a href="https://6217c82bcf3e0600075581ff--platypusweatherapp.netlify.app/">Link</a>

## Overview:

Hello! Welcome to **Platypus Weather**, a user friendly app for everybody, regardless of computer knowledge. My kids, grandparents, other family, and friends all can use it. Plus, they enjoy the cool aesthetic reminiscent of the cool colors a platypus gives off under UV light! _(No really, you should Google it)_. I built this project with the help of a mentor and friend in my journey to become a software engineer.

Simply put in your zip code and the app will show your city’s temperature in Fahrenheit, current weather conditions, the high and low temperature for the day, and wind speed. It’s that easy!

## How to Build:

This project is built with JavaScript - React and TypeScript, using React Router to navigate between pages, and styled with CSS/Sass and MaterialUI. It uses Axios to asynchronously fetch data from [Visual Crossing’s free weather API](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api) allowing the developer to fetch...

- Single API Calls
- Sub-hourly, hourly, & daily
- Current conditions, alerts, & events
- 50+ years of historical data
- CSV & JSON results
- Full location address geocoding

Simply sign up [here](https://www.visualcrossing.com/sign-up), and visual crossing will send you a personalized key, read through the [FAQ](bottom of the page from the first link) follow these [steps](https://www.visualcrossing.com/resources/documentation/weather-api/how-do-i-get-started-with-the-weather-api/) to add your own pre-selected locations built by the API Query Builder, or decide how the user will input. Checkout the full documentation [here](https://www.visualcrossing.com/resources/documentation/weather-data/weather-data-documentation/) including the elements you have access to and the data set structure.
